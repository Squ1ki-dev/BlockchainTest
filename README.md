# BlockchainTest
 
So, I'm not happy with the results of this task, I don't really like (at all) how I performed it, my main problem is not writing a smart contract, I spent 30 minutes finding how to write a simple smart contract (on it's actually fun and useful)
But the problem is that for all this I need to use a plugin, at the current stage I do not have enough knowledge to write my own plugin that will use a smart contract, display the address and others. I read a lot of resources about this and found 1 plugin that can help me, but it costs 200$+
So I decided to use another plugin and between all these plugins I decided to use the Emergency plugin, in this plugin I can create and deploy a contract and also connect any wallet to any network (eg POLYGON, MATIC).
To be real, this plugin is similar to Lego and is good for small projects, but this is one of the ways that I found while I was looking for a solution, it is not a perfect solution, but it is still a solution.
On my part, I failed this assessment, but on the other hand, I got good work experience and lesson with it, I think I will learn about it in the future because I am interested.
